abstract: "
<p>In this extended abstract we establish the need for better ecological validity in evaluating the visualization of uncertainty information. Using weather forecasting as a framework, we also discuss the both the design and results for a pilot user-study that attempts to evaluate the effect of uncertianty visualizations in decisions.</p>"
