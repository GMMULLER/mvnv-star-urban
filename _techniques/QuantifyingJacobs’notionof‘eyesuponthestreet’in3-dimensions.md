abstract: "This study used georeferenced data and technologies to develop a technique for quantifying natural surveillance characteristics of building openings in 3-dimensions. The natural surveillance model accounted for the specification of observer and target points (occupant and road surveillability), architectural and landscape features, and eyewitness identification distance. Occupant and road surveillability measured surveillability of building openings as seen by neighbours and from roads, respectively. Yard vegetation had a significant impact on reducing occupant surveillability. Solid fencing had a significant effect on the reduction of road surveillability. This technique may be used to expand the study of natural surveillance in urban environments."
