abstract: "The impact of reflective and permeable pavements on the urban microclimate is investigated by means of a fully-integrated urban microclimate model. The model couples four submodels: (i) a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, which solves turbulent, convective air flow and the heat and moisture transport in the air, (ii) a Building-Envelope, Heat-Air-Moisture (BE-HAM) model which solves for heat and moisture transport in porous building materials, (iii) a radiation model which computes the radiative heat exchange between urban surfaces and the sky, and (iv) a Wind Driven Rain (WDR) model. The proposed approach yields detailed analysis of the impact of different pavements and meteorological conditions (wind, sun, rain) on the absorption and storage of heat and moisture in urban environments. For the case study, an isolated street canyon and a single rain event are considered. Results obtained from different pavement surfaces are compared in terms of surface temperature and thermal comfort. After a rain event, composite materials with improved hydraulic and reflective properties show larger cooling potential compared to conventional dense materials with dark-colored surfaces indicating that such composite porous and reflective pavements can be efficiently used for urban heat islands mitigation."
