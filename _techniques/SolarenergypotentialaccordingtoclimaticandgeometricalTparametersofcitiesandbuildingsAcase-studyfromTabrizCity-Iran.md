abstract: "This paper focused on the solar energy utilization in cities and buildings as exemplified by Tabriz City in Iran. All the geographic and climatic factors have been considered to estimate the solar energy potential for Tabriz City using angstrom model in SPSS. Then, the solar energy potential in the Blue Mosque (BM) of Tabriz investigated in detail. Decisive parameters in solar energy evaluation such as geographic parameters, climatic factors, radiation types, and orientation techniques and geometry analysis of buildings, were considered based on Tabriz regarding Duffie Beckman and Stephensons cousin methods. The method of Lagrange interpolation regarded to define the elements geometrical equations. The rate of irradiation solar energy was analyzed for domed, horizontal and vertical surfaces of the BM in Tabriz City using Ladybug for Rhino and MS Excel software programs. The results of this study showed that it is possible to domesticate noticeable rate of solar energy in a cloudy climate like Tabriz by appropriate orientation and geometry of building elements."
