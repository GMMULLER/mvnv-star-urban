abstract_note: "This article describes the development of a new three-dimensional model of the British building stock, called ‘3DStock’. The model differs from other 3D urban and stock models, in that it represents explicitly and in detail the spatial relationships between ‘premises’ and ‘buildings’. It also represents the pattern of activities on different floors within buildings. The geometrical/geographical structure of the model is assembled automatically from two existing national data sets. Additional data from other sources including figures for electricity and gas consumption are then attached. Some sample results are given for energy use intensities. The first purpose of the model is in the analysis of energy use in the building stock. With actual energy data for very large numbers of premises, it is possible to take a completely new type of statistical approach, in which consumption can be related to a range of characteristics including activity, built form, construction and materials. Models have been built to date of the London Borough of Camden and the cities of Leicester, Tamworth and Swindon. Work is in progress to extend the modelling to other parts of Britain. Because of the coverage of the data, this will be limited however to England and Wales."
