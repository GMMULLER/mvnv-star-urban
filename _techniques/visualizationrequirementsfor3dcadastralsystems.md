abstract: "In Australia, the cadastre stores and represents land ownership information in subdivision plans on paper and in digital documents (PDF). For a building subdivision, ownership boundaries are commonly drawn on floor plans, with cross-sections or isometric diagrams used to represent the 3D property rights. This method has significant shortcomings for representing property interests, especially in complex multi-level developments. The bounded 3D character of these developments requires numerous plans and sections which are difficult to interpret. It is also not possible to interact with such plans, modifications are not easy or efficient, and searching and measurement can only be done manually. In order to efficiently represent and work with land ownership and related information, this paper proposes a set of requirements (features) for interactive 3D cadastral visualization systems. In our methodology, important features, classified into three categories, have been identified by a review of the literature and also through a consultative workshop with industry partners. The first category includes features specific to visualization of the cadastre in 3D such as underground view and cross-section view. Second are those features that pertain to visualization systems generally such as interactivity and visual representation. Third are additional features that define how a 3D visualization system must behave such as usability and interoperability. A number of existing 3D visualization systems were evaluated against the identified features. Following this analysis, a prototype 3D visualization system was designed and implemented. Then, a case study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed system and this was presented to industry representatives through a workshop. Not all needs were met; for example, those involved in land registry sought greater support for validation of 3D spatial units. However most agreed that the prototype system is able to facilitate understanding of ownership boundaries. Using this feedback, our proposed features were reviewed according to the tasks and requirements of different users."
