abstract: "Although previous researches proved that frequent visits to urban spaces enhance the physical and mental health of people, most governments adopted lockdown policies after the outbreak of COVID-19. This decision has negatively impacted the wellbeing of communities and the livability of urban spaces. In this context the research questions how far the microclimatic conditions of urban space would influence its performance during respiratory pandemics? The study investigated this question through a dense literature survey including 47 scientific journal articles and governmental reports. The outputs were synthesized through a quantitative assessment framework. It detected the spatio-environmental parameters influencing the behaviour of respiratory pandemics in urban settings. To validate the frameworks outputs, the research applied case study sampling for 3 urban spaces in historic Cairo. It generated digital simulations and computations addressing solar radiation, natural ventilation, air temperature, and humidity, besides space dimension and number of users. The results illustrated the areas of adequate and poor microclimatic performance during pandemics. They are demonstrated through numerical tables, digital simulations, and graphs. Eventually, a concluding assessment framework selected the optimum urban space performance to be engaged in the public life of historic Cairo during lockdown periods."
