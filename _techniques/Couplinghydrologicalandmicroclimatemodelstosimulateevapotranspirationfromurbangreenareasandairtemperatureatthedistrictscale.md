abstract: "Understanding and managing hydrological and microclimate conditions is needed for the adaptation of our cities to global warming. Evapotranspiration, or latent heat flux, plays a key role in heat mitigation strategies. Its modelling, as the modelling of its impact on the urban microclimate, remains a scientific challenge, especially during hot periods for which the urban vegetation is subjected to water stress. This article presents an original approach based on the coupling between a hydrological model and a microclimate model to assess the effect of urban green areas on evapotranspiration and air temperatures at the district scale. The approach is applied to a real urban development project, and under future climate conditions. The results show a complex variability of climatic and hydrological behaviour depending on the green zones considered. Results indicate that the water stress control over evapotranspiration can have a significant impact on local surface and air temperatures (respectively 3 to 6 °C and 0.6 and 1.6 °C difference as compared to ideal water availability conditions)."
