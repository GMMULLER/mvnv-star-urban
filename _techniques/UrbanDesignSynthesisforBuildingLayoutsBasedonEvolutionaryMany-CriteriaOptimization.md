abstract: "When working on urban planning projects there are usually multiple aspects to consider. Often these aspects are contradictory and it is not possible to choose one over the other; instead, they each need to be fulfilled as well as possible. In this situation ideal solutions are not always found because they are either not sought or the problems are regarded as being too complex for human capabilities. To improve this situation we propose complementing traditional design approaches with a design synthesis process based on evolutionary many-criteria optimization methods that can fulfill formalizable design requirements. In addition we show how self-organizing maps can be used to visualize many-dimensional solution spaces in an easily analyzable and comprehensible form. The system is presented using an urban planning scenario for the placement of building volumes."
