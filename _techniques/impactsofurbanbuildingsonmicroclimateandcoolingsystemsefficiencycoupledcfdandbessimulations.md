abstract: "The present research investigates thermal and aerodynamic effects of urban buildings on microclimate and, subsequently, on cooling systems performance. To this end, a real heterogeneous urban area in the Mediterranean climate is considered. By employing open-source tools of OpenFOAM and EnergyPlus, coupled CFD-BES simulations are conducted. In this regard, the Detailed Surface Boundary Condition Coupling (DSBCC) algorithm is proposed. It mainly focuses on meticulously detaching any patches with different thermal properties or orientation to capture their effects on cooling units. Numerical simulations are validated by performing on-site measurements. Results elucidate the wind patternâ€™s pivotal role in alleviating or aggravating the local Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity. Research outcomes indicate a stabilized efficiency for split units in all situations. The effect of hot solid walls on the adjacent air is neutralized by low-temperature glass windows. On the other hand, highly irradiated roofs create thermally critical zones, where local UHI is escalated by 3.5 K and the efficiency of rooftop units (RTU) is detracted by 46.7 %. A stronger wind speed (6 instead of 2 m/s) can enhance RTUs performance by 20.7 %. Ultimately, an optimal location for RTUs can elevate their efficiency by 42.4 % and 14.4 %, regarding shadowing effect and wind ventilation, respectively."
