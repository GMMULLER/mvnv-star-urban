abstract: "3D city models and their browser-based applications have become an increasingly applied tool in the cities. One of their applications is the analysis views and visibility, applicable to property valuation and evaluation of urban green infrastructure. We present a near real-time semantic view analysis relying on a 3D city model, implemented in a web browser. The analysis is tested in two alternative use cases: property valuation and evaluation of the urban green infrastructure. The results describe the elements visible from a given location, and can also be applied to object type specific analysis, such as green view index estimation, with the main benefit being the freedom of choosing the point-of-view obtained with the 3D model. Several promising development directions can be identified based on the current implementation and experiment results, including the integration of the semantic view analysis with virtual reality immersive visualization or 3D city model application development platforms."
