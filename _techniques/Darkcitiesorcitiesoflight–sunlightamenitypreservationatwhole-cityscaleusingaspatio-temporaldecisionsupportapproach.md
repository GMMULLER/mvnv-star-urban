abstract_note: "Public open spaces are fundamentally important for the health and well-being of citizens in densely populated cities. If not carefully planned, high-density urban development can overshadow adjacent open spaces, resulting in poor quality, dark and oppressive winter conditions. Current planning control approaches for protecting light amenity in cities are often limited to simple overshadowing impact diagrams (e.g. shadows cast on the equinox at 9 a.m., 12 p.m. and 3 p.m.). In cities transitioning from low to higher density, comprising more complex urban forms and more extreme seasonal light amenity dynamics, these static approaches are insufficient. This paper outlines the development of a spatio-temporal design decision support system for analysing and protecting the light amenity of public open spaces, applied to a capital city in Australia. The system described has two parts: Firstly, to assess the overshadowing of existing public open spaces and identify those in need of protection (Part A), and secondly to generate planning restrictions to protect designated open spaces from future deprivation of light (Part B). For Part A, we use a graphics processing unit accelerated aggregate-shadow (15 minute increments) calculation applied to a detailed city-wide 3D model generated from billions of points of aerial survey (LiDAR) data. For Part B, we use a reversed solar ray casting approach we call the ‘Subtracto-Sun’ which allows a user to specify a time range (e.g. 9 a.m.–4 p.m.) for multiple days of the year and subsequent generation of 3D maximum building height development envelopes. The output of this system was used by the local government to inform a proposed planning policy amendment for the City of Melbourne. The findings illustrate the potential for urban professionals to use the system to rapidly assess shadow impacts for existing and proposed, contextually accurate, large, complex urban environments with high levels of geometric and temporal details. The presented results are significant in that we develop and apply our spatio-temporal decision-support approach to a local government area, successfully informing planning height restriction decisions to protect daylight amenity of public open spaces in need of protection. Our method for setting development height restrictions allows for higher density to be achieved, while not increasing the overshadowing of critical open space infrastructure during designated times."
