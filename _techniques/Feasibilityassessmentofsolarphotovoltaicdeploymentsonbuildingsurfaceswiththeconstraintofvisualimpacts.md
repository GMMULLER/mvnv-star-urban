abstract: "As a major component of social acceptance, visual impact is often considered a significant constraint in solar applications. Visual impact assessment of solar applications, however, has been limited to pedestrians in previous studies. The extent to which PV systems can have visual impacts on occupants and whether it is necessary to include occupants in the measurement of visual impact remains uncertain. To fill this gap, we extended it from pedestrians to occupants and proposed a quantitative method to integrate pedestrians and occupants into a framework, combining the estimation of solar potential for the feasibility assessment of PV applications in a built environment. The concept is tested with a real case, located in Qingdao city, China, to present the technical flowchart for the feasibility assessment of solar PV deployments with the visual constraint. Building surfaces with qualified solar irradiation and low visibility were identified and compared in two cases, that is, with and without the inclusion of occupants as the visual constraint. The comparison results show that the change of suitable building surfaces for solar applications is 172,306 m2 (21% of suitable area) and 126 GWh (19% of yield energy) across the study area, indicating the significance of including occupants in the visibility assessment for the deployment of solar applications. The proposed method considers the visual constraint for the feasibility assessment of solar applications from the perspective of pedestrians and occupants, and it is helpful to identify the suitable surfaces for the large-scale deployment of solar applications at an early planning stage of solar city."
