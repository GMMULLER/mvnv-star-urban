abstract: "Since the 20th century, shrinking cities have become a crucial subject in urban planning and public health literature. Given the growing concern about heat stress, a planning method for managing shrinking cities is increasingly linked with improvement of urban thermal comfort. The purpose of this study is to identify policy implications for developing so-called “decline-oriented strategies” that help to mitigate heat stress. The article assesses the effects of three strategies: 1) demolition strategy of abandoned houses, 2) demolition and greening the site strategy, and 3) small-scale urban renewal strategy. Using ENVI-met, we performed a comparative analysis of the differences in thermal comfort levels associated with each strategy. The results showed that the pre-post differences in thermal comfort were statistically significant for each strategy. Overall, the demolition strategy without greening elevated the surface temperature due to more extensive open areas without shade, forming a heat stress zone around vacant lots. The greening strategy partly offset the adverse effects of the demolition strategy by providing a thermally pleasant environment. Finally, the small-scale urban renewal strategy improved the thermal environment and provided a potential cooling zone, which pedestrians and residents could utilize."
