description : Attribute Driven Layouts use node position encode attributes. We distinguish two cases:attribute driven faceting, which places the nodes in regions corresponding to a categorical attribute but the exact node position within that region is determined in another way, or attribute driven positioning, which places the nodes exactly by an (often numerical) attribute value.
