abstract: "Managing urban air systems is now on top priority. The local wind flow at the building scale is governed by the urban morphology, which is difficult to be captured by the parameterizations of the regional scale weather models. In this study, we dynamically downscaled the 1 km resolution wind flow simulated by the WRF-UCM (Weather Research and Forecasting with Urban Canopy Model) to the building scale (<10 m), by integrating it with the OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation, OF) computational fluid dynamics model (WRF-UCM + OF). The Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes k-ε turbulence model has been used with a steady-state solver in the OF. Momentum sink due to vegetation has been accounted for by Darcy-Forchheimer model. The model simulated hourly 10-m wind speed and direction in a 1 km2 area were evaluated with the measured values during January 11–18, 2018 over Nagpur City, India. The results show that WRF-UCM + OF has captured the wind direction more accurately than the WRF-UCM. The WRF-UCM + OF simulated wind speed has significantly low normalized mean bias (NMB = −0.002) and low normalized mean gross error (NMGE = 0.588) when compared with that of the WRF-UCM model (NMB = 1.083 and NMGE = 1.216)."
