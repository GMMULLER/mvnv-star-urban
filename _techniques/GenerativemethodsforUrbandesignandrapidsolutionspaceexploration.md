abstract: "Rapid population growth and climate change drive urban renewal and urbanization at massive scales. New computational methods are needed to better support urban designers in developing sustainable, resilient, and livable urban environments. Urban design space exploration and multi-objective optimization of masterplans can be used to expedite planning while achieving better design outcomes by incorporating generative parametric modeling considering different stakeholder requirements and simulation-based performance feedback. However, a lack of generalizable and integrative methods for urban form generation that can be coupled with simulation and various design performance analysis constrains the extensibility of workflows. This research introduces an implementation of a tensor-fieldâ€“based generative urban modeling toolkit that facilitates rapid design space exploration and multi-objective optimization by integrating with Rhino/Grasshopper ecosystem and its urban analysis and environmental performance simulation tools. Our tensor-field modeling method provides users with a generalized way to encode contextual constraints such as waterfront edges, terrain, view-axis, existing streets, landmarks, and non-geometric design inputs such as network directionality, desired densities of streets, amenities, buildings, and people as forces that modelers can weigh. This allows users to generate many, diverse urban fabric configurations that resemble real-world cities with very few model inputs. We present a case study to demonstrate the proposed frameworks flexibility and applicability and show how modelers can identify design and environmental performance synergies that would be hard to find otherwise."
