abstract: "Noise mapping is the process of determining and visualizing noise impact on the environment in order to support environmental policies. Currently most noise impact studies are based on a 2D approach. The 3D output of noise simulation software is processed and visualized in 2D and combined with 2D topographical and other data, such as population distribution, to quantify the effects. The research described in this paper aims at improving visualization and assessment of noise impact on the environment by generating a 3D noise map in cases where 3D effects are relevant. Based on the specific demand, an approach is presented to generate a 3D noise map as a basis for noise impact studies. The proposed concept is proofed by applying it to a sample noise impact study. From experiences with the sample, it can be concluded that the 3D noise map offers significant insight in situations where 3D noise effects are relevant, i.e. in urban areas. Here, current 2D noise maps have limitations. In addition, more accurate assessment of noise impact is possible in particular when different floors of a building close to the noise source and/or behind noise barriers are considered. This paper also elaborates on accuracy aspects in all phases of noise modelling, including a presentation of initial experiments of 3D noise interpolation."
