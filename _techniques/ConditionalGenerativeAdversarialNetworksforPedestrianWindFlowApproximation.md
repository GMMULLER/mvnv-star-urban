abstract: "Despite the vital role the wind microclimate plays in urban design, the time, cost and computational expense of wind simulations make them ineffective during early design stages. Surrogate models have been explored as an alternative to the traditional time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for wind flow approximation in urban contexts. Current approaches, however, have limitations that hinder their applicability and integration in early design pedestrian wind microclimate studies. The highvolume of data generated from CFD simulations provides a practical opportunity for exploring data-driven surrogate models. This paper proposes and evaluates a conditional generative adversarial network surrogate model for the design contribution of urban morphologies to pedestrian wind flow conditions. The validity of the approach is demonstrated at a fraction of the time that would be required to perform the equivalent conventional simulation. Variations in dataset encoding techniques, image resolutions and geometric diversity of the training set are explored to identify the key parameters affecting model’s accuracy and suitability for the intended application. Larger urban configuration datasets are recommended to further reduce errors and instill confidence in model predictions for urban contexts quite far from the training set."
