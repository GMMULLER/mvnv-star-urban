My research interests focus ways non-expert users (a.k.a the general public) engage with technology and ways of making the experience more intuitive.  I am co-advised by [Miriah Meyer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/) and [Jason Weise](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~wiese/) and currently working the NIH's [PRISMS](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding/prisms) project to help "develop health monitoring systems for measuring environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in pediatric epidemiological studies of asthma".  I just make user interfaces for our participants :P

I'm a bit of an atypical CS student, and even more so a visualization researcher.  My academic background is in math and physics with some professional R&D experience as an electro-optic engineer for spice. I came to Utah for a scientific computing PhD, but switched course to visualization in order to pursue a more collaborative and problem-driven line of research.

When I'm not on campus I like to cook, build speakers, and play synthesizers.
